# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## **Overview** 
The purpose of this analysis is to apply deep neural network machine learnign algorithms to determine whether or not an organization that is funded by AlphabetSoup is successfull 

## **Results**
  - Data Preprocessing
    - What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?                         
      The target for this model is prediction whether or not the charity is successful.

    - What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?                                     
    ![features](https://github.com/nsmeltz/Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis/blob/9f803b99525d9cd329d43ae2489345b9cf3491d7/Images/features.jpg)
   
    - What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

  - Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
    - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
    - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
    
## **Summary**
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
